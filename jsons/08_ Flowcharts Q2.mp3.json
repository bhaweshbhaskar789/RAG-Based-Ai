" Hi everyone, welcome to the supreme batch In this video we will discuss How to get the parameter of triangle and how to write its flowchart and pseudocode First of all, let's see what is a parameter This is your triangle You have made a triangle Its sides are A, B, C These are its sides Parameter is the sum of all its sides So if I want to get the parameter I will do A plus B plus C Let's see an example If I have a triangle whose A is 10 cm and B is 20 cm and C is 30 cm So what will be its parameter Parameter is 10 plus 20 plus 30 cm This will be 60 cm So this is your parameter Now let's see how to make its solution and what will be its flowchart First of all, we need A, B and C We will take input from the user User will tell you how to get the parameter of triangle Let's see how to make flowchart First of all, we will create a start block After that we will read the input We will read from user We will read three variables After that we will do processing We will give instruction to CPU to get the parameter and give A, B and C as plus CPU will give A, B and C as plus and store it in P A, B and C will be plus and stored in P So our answer is in P Now we will print P We will create output block for print So we will print P After that we will end We will print P We will print P After that we will do processing After that we will print P So this is the flowchart for getting the parameter of triangle Let's see its pseudocode Pseudocode is simple You can make flowchart easily You have to write your algorithm in English First of all, you will read A, B, C After that you will make P Parameter is A, B, C After that you will print P That's it So this is how you can get the parameter of triangle You have a flowchart and pseudocode How is flowchart and pseudocode helpful? You can easily code it in any language See you in next video Till then, Goodbye"}
