see how to calculate simple interest programmatically and what will be its flowchart What is simple interest? I call simple interest as SI What is simple interest? It is your principal multiplied by rate of interest multiplied by time period We divide it by 100 This is your formula of simple interest What are the banks that give interest? Banks give compounding interest Simple interest is not given Simple interest is calculated like this Let's see an example Suppose you are given a question in which your principal is 10 rupees your rate of interest is 10% and your time period is 1 year How will you calculate simple interest? You will do 10 multiplied by 10 and multiply it by 100 This is your formula This is your formula This is your formula 10 multiplied by 10 10 multiplied by 1 10 multiplied by 1 divided by 100 This is your simple interest This is your simple interest We will cut it as 1 You can calculate simple interest like this Let's see how to do it programmatically Let's see how to do it programmatically I need P, R and T I need P, R and T These inputs from user You are all smart First we will take input from user After taking input, we will apply this formula After applying, we will print it In this way, it will have a pseudocode and flowchart In this way, it will have a pseudocode and flowchart Let's make a flowchart quickly How to make a flowchart? First we will start First we will start We will read P R and T We will read P R and T We will apply formula We will apply formula We will apply formula SI equal to P multiplied by R multiplied by T divided by 100 Very good Now we will make an output block Now we will make an output block We will print We will print After that, our CPU will end After that, our CPU will end Our program will end In this way, simple flow will be made You took input from user You calculated simple interest and printed it This is your flowchart Now let's see How will be the pseudocode? Very easy First you will read P, R and T After that, you will apply SI After that, you will print SI This is your pseudocode of flowchart To print simple interest See you in next video Goodbye"}
