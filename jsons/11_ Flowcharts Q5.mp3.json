  "text": " Hi everyone, welcome to the supreme batch In this video, we are going to see how to find a factorial of a number How to find a factorial from a computer And how to make a flowchart of this algorithm What is its pseudocode First of all, let's know what is a factorial What is a factorial Factorial means you said n Tell me the factorial of n Tell me the factorial of n This is your sign of factorial So, factorial of n means I will multiply n from n-1 Then I will multiply n from n-2 Then I will multiply n from n-3 And I will keep multiplying till 1 comes here This is your factorial Let's understand it through an example Suppose n is 5 5 factorial means we will multiply 5 from 4 We will multiply 5 from 3 We will multiply 5 from 2 We will multiply 5 from 1 The answer is 120 Let's see another example Suppose n is 3 3 factorial means n Here 3 is here 3 multiply 3-1 n-1 3 multiply n-2 3-2 That is 1 This is factorial of any number How to calculate You must be having an intuition We will use a loop We will start from n Then n-1 n-2 We will keep doing it till 1 comes I will multiply all of them Let's make a flowchart To make a flowchart First we will make a start block After start, I will read n I will read n After reading n I will need a variable In which I will store factorial Let's take a variable I will initialize it as fact We will initialize it as 1 What will be 1 factorial 1 is the smallest number 1 factorial is 1 We have initialized it as 1 Let's move ahead I will need a condition I have to run a loop I have seen that It is necessary to run a loop I will keep decrementing n Suppose when n is greater than or equal to 1 If n is greater than or equal to 1 What will we do? If n is greater than 1 What will we do? We will multiply factorial by n We will multiply factorial by n After that We will decrement n We will decrement n n is equal to n-1 After that After that I will run the loop This loop will keep running Let's understand an example If there is confusion Suppose I took n as 5 First 5 will be read Then I took a variable I took a variable as fact I initialized it as 1 Now I am checking if n is greater than or equal to 1 If n is greater than or equal to 5 What will we do? Fact is equal to fact Now I multiply 5 Now my fact is 5 After that I will decrement n n is equal to n-1 which is 5-1 Now let's come back Your loop will keep running We will check if 4 is greater than 1 Yes, it is If 4 is greater than 1 Now what is the value of fact? It is 5 Now we multiply n n is equal to 4 What will be the value of fact? It is 20 Now we will decrement n n-1 It is 3 Similarly Fact is equal to 20 multiplied by 3 You will keep doing like this Similarly 5 multiplied by 4 multiplied by 3 2 multiplied by 1 Finally, it is 120 Now see carefully If n is equal to 1 Then it will fulfill the condition When n is less than or equal to 1 Then what we have to do? What we have to do on no condition? In no condition We will create an output block and print fact and then stop Okay We have created a flowchart to find factorial We can create a pseudocode by looking at flowchart Pseudocode will be similar We will read n Then we will initialize a variable Then we will check the condition If n is greater than 1 Till n is greater than or equal to 1 We will keep doing fact multiplied by n We will decrement n When n is less than or equal to 1 Then we will print the fourth condition and the pseudocode will be end Okay This was the factorial of pseudocode and flowchart See you in next video Good Bye"
