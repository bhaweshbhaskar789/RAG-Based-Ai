bye"}], "text": " Hi everyone, welcome to the supreme batch In this video we are going to see if you have been given a number then is that number prime or not how will you find it what will be its flowchart and pseudocode before we reach to flowchart and pseudocode let's see what is prime number what is prime number what is prime number prime number is any number n prime will be when it has exactly two factors two factors what will be those two factors first factor will be one you know that one is divisible by one second will be second condition that n is its own factor n is n's own factor n comes in n's table n can be divided by n similarly n can be divided by 1 if there are exactly two factors one is 1 and other is itself then it will be prime let's see a simple example example is 5 5 is prime number because who can divide 5 5 can be divided by 1 5 divided by 1 5 can be divided by 1 and 5 can be divided by 5 means between 1 and 5 if i draw something 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 if i see does 5 get divided by 1 yes it can does 5 get divided by 2 2 gets divided by 100% No similarly can 5 get divided by 3 No can 5 get divided by 4 No can 5 get divided by 5 Yes it can see carefully one factor is 1 and other is 5 if it is like this then it is prime number otherwise it is not how to do it programmatically to do it programmatically to do it you will see input is n you will see from 1 to 2 3 n you will see all numbers and see does n does n between 1 to n can be divided by anyone if it can be divided by anyone completely then it is prime otherwise it is prime how to check it mathematically you have an operator which is % % operator it is also called model operator you will see from 2 to n all numbers in between suppose it is i ith number can it divide n then you will do n modulo i if it is 0 means any number is available between 1 to n which can completely divide n means remainder is 0 modulo operator gives remainder means this particular number is not prime you will see it simply if any such condition is yes then you will say prime is not there if any such condition is not there then it is prime let's make a flow chart we will start from start we will start from start after that I am going to read n we will take input from user after that I will initialize a variable what will that variable do that variable will go from here to n-1 means from 2 to n-1 and this loop will run what will this loop do it is any n we will take modulo of it from this particular number let's assume it is i we will arrange i from 2 to n-1 and n modulo i means it is not prime very good we initialize i from 2 why from 2 because I know for prime checking condition is there should be one factor and n factor there should be no factor in between so I have to iterate i between 1 and n means i value will go from 2 to n-1 let's move ahead what I will do first check the condition is your i less than n because I have to go from 2 to n-1 if it is not not the condition first check yes condition if it is then we will modulo n from i and check is it coming 0 ok if it is coming 0 then we will say it is 0 let's see the example suppose your n is 6 ok 1,2,3,4,5,6 I will move the window from 2 to 5 I will see it is divisible from 1 and divisible from 6 6 is divisible from 6 and 6 is divisible from 1 1 and 6 should be two factors no factor should be divisible from any of them now see carefully i will go from 2 to 5 and when I will do 6 modulo 2 then it will come 0 because 2,3 are 6 means 6 comes in 2's table then what will happen I will say not a prime because I have got a number from which divide is not possible similarly if it is 0 then what I will do I will print not prime ok we will print not prime and if it is not then we will check for next number we will check for next number and before checking for next number what I have to do increment i I will put a block here i equal to i plus 1 till here I have understood now let's see suppose I have done all the loop from i to i from 2 to n minus 1 I have done the loop means let's see the example of 5 if n is equal to 5 1,2,3,4,5 2,3,4 I have seen dividing from 2 5 is not possible I have seen dividing from 4 5 is not possible when this condition comes i will reach 5 less than 5 this condition will come then condition will be false when this condition will be false then it has only two factors 1 and 5 I will say this thing is this particular number is prime, means I will print prime after that what I will do I will make end block let's end it ok so this is the flow chart to find a particular number is it prime or not let's see the pseudocode it is very simple to make you will read n set i to 2 then run a loop condition will check if n if I divide it from i does it come 0 if it comes 0 then simply we will say not a prime not a prime and go to 5 means we will go to end block if it is not so then we will check for i condition from i equal to 2 to n minus 1 we will check and if i is equal to plus 1 then I will check the condition again and keep doing it till n minus 1 and when this condition fails we will print on else yes this number was prime see you in the next video, till then good bye"}
