and flowchart of this First of all we want to see what is n here n is input from user input from user is a number from which I will start i.e. I will start from n suppose if n is 5 then I will start from 5 I will print 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 similarly if n is 10 then I will print 10, 9, 8, 7, ... till 1 so we are understanding what input we have to take from user from user I have to take n input user input after that after that what I have to do after that I have to run a loop from n to 1 i.e. I have to run n times a loop I will take input after that I will run n times a loop and through that loop I will print current number I will do something like this let's see how flowchart is going to be while making flowchart first we will similarly make a start after that I am going to read I will make an input block I will read from upper tab after that I want to do a counting I will use a loop and I want to run it n times I will need a variable I will assign a variable from n this variable is a processing block ok it is a processing block because n is assigned in I who will do this? CPU will assign so it is a processing block after that what I will do after that I will apply a condition ok we will make a decision is your I greater than or equal to 1 if it is greater than or equal to 1 means yes condition so you all are smart what we have to do we have to print I where I started from? from n so first n will be printed after that after that I will decrement I from I-1 ok first n will be there then n-1 after n-1 I will check the same condition condition will check is the new I suppose n was 5 you printed 5 then decrement 5 5-1 that is 4 now you will check 4 is 4 greater than or equal to 1 if it is 4 then you will loop again so this is looping now one condition is left if I is not greater than or equal to 1 means you will reach 1 you printed 1 after that I is 0 at that point condition will be false what you will do simply end ok so this is your simple flowchart in which we used looping and printing counting its pseudocode is very easy we can make pseudocode by looking at flowchart what will pseudocode do similar thing read n set I from n after that we will check condition this is the third condition we will check is I greater than or equal to 1 if yes then we will print otherwise we will decrement I after printing we will decrement n after n is 1 means I is equal to I-1 after that we will write in pseudocode go to 3 now we will go back go to 3 is this arrow go to 3 if it is not in case of no condition we will stop so this is your counting printing back counting from n to 1 flowchart and pseudocode"}
